00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.630
Colorful Cape Town is one of the most multi-racial
cities in the world.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.530
The city sits on South Africa’s Cape Peninsula,

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.120
where the waters of the Atlantic
and Indian Oceans converge,

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.089
and spectacular mountains tumble towards the sea.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.899
For centuries, the Cape of Good Hope
was synonymous with danger,

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:41.079
as European ships bravely rounded the perilous
waters on route to the riches of Asia.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.740
To resupply those passing ships,
the Dutch created a tiny outpost in 1652,

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.640
a settlement that would blossom into one of
the most beautiful cities,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.260
in one of the most breathtaking settings
on earth.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.960
For decades, Cape Town has been buffeted too,

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.239
by the cross-winds of social upheaval.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.750
But just like those early ships,

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.890
Cape Town had endured some of history’s
most turbulent waters,

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.310
and set course to an optimistic future.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.100
This is a city that despite its challenges,

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.020
shines as an example of hope,
not only to South Africa,

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.000
but to the world.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.840
Cape Town’s central area is situated in

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.710
the City Bowl.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.340
This amphitheater-shaped area begins
at the edge of Table Bay

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.760
and is backed by the iconic two-mile long
plateau of Table Mountain.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.240
Near the bowl’s center,

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.790
you’ll find The Castle of Good Hope.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.640
This Dutch East India fort was the center
point from which the city grew.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.720
Nearby, visit Company’s Garden,

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.740
whose rich soils were cultivated to provide
fresh produce for those early merchant ships.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.920
All around the gardens,

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.810
some of the city’s most important institutions
sprang up,

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.160
such as the Parliament Building,
and the National Library.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.400
On the park’s southern end,

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.600
in the South African Museum and Planetarium,

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.750
experience the wonders of Africa,

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.520
from the power of pre-colonial rock art
to the giants of The Cape’s natural world.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.700
While just a few steps away,

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.680
centuries of creativity are on full display
at the National Gallery.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.780
Fusing both contemporary and old-world architecture,

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.940
the nearby South African Jewish Museum stands
as a tribute to a community that has done

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.490
much to shape the country.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.440
Just a few blocks away, don’t miss
the District Six Museum.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.500
This museum and cultural center gives voice
to the 60,000 non-white residents

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.780
who were forcibly removed from the city and
saw their vibrant multi-racial neighborhood flattened

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.280
during the darkest days of the Apartheid Era.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.580
Thankfully, one neighborhood that was spared

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.090
from apartheid’s wrecking ball,

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.770
is Bo-Kaap.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.560
Despite decades of racial segregation,

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:42.300
traditional Cape Malay culture proudly continues
amid the row houses and cobbled streets of

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.560
this incredibly colorful hillside suburb.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.840
Post-apartheid South Africa is often called
The Rainbow Nation,

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.340
and like a pot of gold at the end of
that rainbow, diversity,

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.360
transformation and creativity shines out from
the city’s downtown streets,

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.379
from it’s businesses,
from it’s very walls.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.520
If you’re passionate about coffee,

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.460
stop by for an espresso, or maybe two, at Truth,

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.980
a steampunk coffee shop that welcomes devotees
from all over the world.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.860
Once you’ve had your caffeine fix,

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.680
wander along Long Street,
where elegant Victorian architecture,

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.040
fashion, and food collide,

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.280
creating one of The Mother City’s
buzziest streets.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.800
When the coffee wears off,

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:49.290
sit on a balcony with an ice-cold beer and
watch the world slip by below.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.759
The spirit of rejuvenation continues at the
Victoria and Alfred Waterfront.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.500
At South Africa’s oldest working harbor,

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.200
spend the day exploring attractions,

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:12.360
such as Two Oceans Aquarium, which celebrates
life beneath the waves of both the Atlantic,

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.620
and Indian Oceans.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.080
The waterfront is also the gateway

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.000
to one of the world’s most infamous prisons,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.499
Robben Island.

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:35.379
Journey across the waters of Table Bay to
experience the damp prison walls and windswept yards,

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.120
and to listen to stories told
by former inmates.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.740
For three centuries this was a place of exile,

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.870
largely unknown by the outside world,

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:55.610
until 1964 when the anti-apartheid revolutionary,
Nelson Mandela was imprisoned here for 18 years.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.760
A visit here is a reminder of just how far
South Africa has travelled

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.120
on the long road to freedom.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.960
Mandela would one day rise,

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:13.300
to become more than South Africa’s first
black president…he became the father of the nation,

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.140
and inspired countless millions around the world.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.200
Mandela once said that it was the presence of Table Mountain,

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.720
across those four miles of water,

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.100
that inspired him throughout his long years
on Robben Island.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.260
Wherever you are on the Cape,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.919
Table Mountain is there,

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:41.319
a beloved landmark that helps locals and
visitors alike to find their way.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.620
The closer you get to the mists of Table Mountain,

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.900
the more its spirit can be felt.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.440
At Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens,

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.240
gaze up at the mountain’s eastern face,

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:01.069
then explore South Africa’s many biomes
and the Boomslang walkway which snakes its

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:04.489
way through the arboretum canopy.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:11.520
From the gardens, take one of the walking trails
up the mountain,

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.700
or climb aboard the Cableway for
the spectacular ride to the viewing area.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:24.719
From here, take in the views of Signal Hill, Devil’s
Peak, and Lions Head, all the way out

00:07:24.719 --> 00:07:28.279
to Robben Island and beyond.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.599
Cape Town is one of the world’s great beach cities,

00:07:42.599 --> 00:07:47.599
with countless beaches, bays
and seaside communities,

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:50.139
each with its own unique vibe.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:54.680
From Green Point, the site of Cape Town’s
futuristic stadium,

00:07:54.680 --> 00:08:01.780
head down the western coast of the Cape Peninsula
to one incredible beach after another.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.639
Starting at the city center,

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:14.080
the wide promenade of Milton Beach is a great
place to stretch your legs.

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.319
A little further south in Clifton,

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:23.520
some of the country’s most expensive homes spill down
from the peninsula to the four beaches below,

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:30.620
each one separated by falls of granite boulders
which offer great shelter on windy days.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.860
While a house at Clifton will set you back
millions,

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:40.130
the views of the sparkling Atlantic,
Lions Head, and The Twelve Apostles are just

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:43.750
as they’ve always been, free.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:52.120
At neighboring Camps Bay Beach
the St Tropez theme continues.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:58.000
Just a 5-minute drive from the center of
Cape Town, enjoy fine white sands,

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:04.450
a tranquil tidal pool and your pick of over
20 restaurants and cafés.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:14.500
Six miles down the coast, things mellow out even more,
at Llandudno Beach.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:20.400
Pull on a wetsuit and enjoy the waves, or
just explore the massive granite boulders.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:30.600
Life is simple here, there’s no street lights,
no restaurants, and not a single shop.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.080
When your belly starts to grumble, pop around

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.840
the headland to the fishing village of Hout Bay.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:49.139
Cool off with a craft beer,
see what’s cooking at the markets,

00:09:49.139 --> 00:09:53.739
then hang out with locals down by the
tuna and crayfish boats.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.260
Once you’ve explored the peninsula's western coastline,

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:09.050
the eastern side awaits.

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:12.820
Welcome to False Bay,
where the waters are warmer,

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:18.060
and the never-ending sweep of beaches and
scenic seaports continues.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.920
At the naval port of Simon’s Town,

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.540
head down the “historic mile” of St. George's Street.

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:33.680
Soak up the nautical spirit, say hello to
a much-loved sea dog,

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:39.240
and explore the alleyways and lacey Victorian
buildings along the way.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:45.480
Don’t leave Simon’s Town until you’ve visited
Boulders Beach,

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:51.500
one of the few places in the world where you
can get close to endangered African Penguins.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.240
False Bay was once dotted with humble farming

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.540
and whaling villages, like Fish Hoek.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:18.360
From here, follow the coastal walk around
to Kalk Bay, where writers,

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:25.300
musicians and artists have replaced the whalers
and lime burners of yesteryear.

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:29.690
Thankfully, the bay’s fishing boats still
put out to sea,

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:34.510
ensuring the local restaurants are always
well-stocked with the freshest seafood.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:42.060
When it comes time to drag yourself away,

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.700
head to neighboring St James,

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:49.970
known for its colorful Victorian bathing boxes
and grand old houses

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:54.570
which reflect the splendor of the early diamond
and gold-mining era.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:02.680
Right next door, the mood changes again, at Muizenberg,

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:07.240
home to some of the most laid-back vibes in
South Africa.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:12.460
With its warm, shallow water
it’s the perfect beach for families.

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:14.830
And if you’ve ever wanted to surf,

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:17.450
this is the place to learn!

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.100
Muizies is after all,

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.760
the birthplace of South African surfing.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.680
While the beach at Muizies can get packed
in summer,

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:32.700
you’ll find plenty of cool escapes in the
streets of this arty village.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:36.870
From here, over 12 miles of fine sands stretch

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:41.450
all the way around to historic Gordon’s Bay.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.880
Just around the corner at Kogel Bay,

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:53.340
the only sounds you’ll hear are the pebbles
and shells rolling in with the incoming tide.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.720
Cape Town’s riches don’t end with its beaches,

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:08.700
it’s also blessed with some of the best
wine growing country in the world.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:18.680
The Cape’s first vines were planted

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:21.160
in Company’s Gardens in 1655

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.480
to help those passing sailors ward off scurvy.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:31.600
But the roots of the nation’s winemaking industry
really took hold just twenty minutes drive away,

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:34.750
in the suburb of Constantia.

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:39.620
In the late 1600s, hundreds of vines
were planted here,

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:44.130
along with rows of oaks to shield them from
the harsh Cape winds.

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.870
From here those vines spread,

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:52.870
far beyond Cape Town, into a region now known
as The Winelands.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:59.400
Choose from 18 different wine routes centered
around historic villages and towns,

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:04.940
and discover vast vineyards in settings that
will take your breath away.

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:09.380
Many of the estates are characterized by historic
Cape Dutch-style manors,

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:12.160
as well as restaurants and tasting rooms

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.220
where you can savor the very essence 
of this fertile land.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.700
After touring the acclaimed wineries of Paarl,

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:25.310
such as Laborie, and Vrede en Lust,

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:29.870
explore the streets and architecture of this
300-year-old town.

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:43.050
High above Paarl stands the Taal Monument,
which celebrates the Language of Afrikaans,

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:49.090
a language that was forbidden during the bitter
aftermath of the Anglo-Boer War in 1902.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:55.780
The Stellenbosch Wine Route, South Africa's oldest,

00:14:55.780 --> 00:15:01.860
offers more than 150 tasting rooms across
200 vineyards.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:08.320
At the Waterford Estate take a 2-hour wine
safari through the Bordeaux-inspired estate,

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:13.400
then taste some of the most exciting new reds
in the region.

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:21.780
Just a 30 minute drive from Stellenbosch,

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.730
and only 50 from Cape Town,

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:27.570
is perhaps the most beautiful wine route
of them all,

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:30.440
the Franschhoek Wine Route.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:34.220
Fleeing religious persecution
in 17th century Europe,

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:37.200
200 French Huguenots, came to this valley,

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:40.020
and created paradise.

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:44.860
Today, Franschhoek is considered the food
and wine capital of South Africa.

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:49.740
At Boschendal, one of the country’s very
first estates,

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:54.640
the influence, style and passion of the French
is everywhere.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.900
It also lingers in the town itself,

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:04.250
in the galleries, the museums,
and in the memorial,

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:08.380
which depicts a female figure casting off
the cloak of oppression

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:12.630
and gazing towards an optimistic future.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.580
Before you head back to Cape Town, head up

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:19.850
Franschhoek Pass,

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:22.630
one of the Cape’s most scenic drives.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:28.040
High in the Mont Rochelle Nature Reserve,
soak up the views of the valley below,

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.600
and wander hillsides filled with proteas,

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:36.420
a flower first discovered on the Cape and
now cultivated all over the world.

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:41.000
In local tradition, the Protea represents

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:42.260
transformation,

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.010
courage and hope.

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:48.390
Cape Town is a city which shares the same soil,

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:53.050
so it’s not surprising that it embodies
those same qualities too.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:58.440
But Cape Town is more than just a single flower,

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:00.130
it’s a garden.

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:05.430
From it’s earliest days as a resupply station
for passing sailors,

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:08.649
through the bitter harvests of the Apartheid era,

00:17:08.659 --> 00:17:13.679
this is a garden where hands of every color
have planted seeds of hope,

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:17.060
and have held the fruits of freedom.

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:24.520
So come, and savor the colors, hope and freedom,
of Cape Town.
